# Parts needed

## Frame parts

I used Kee Klamps and 3/4" ND pipe for the frame, except for the flange on the baseboard which is 1" ND. Kee Klamps are a kind of Meccano/Erector set for constructions like this; they're expensive but very flexible if you build up a collection of pipes. 

Confusingly, pipes have a "nominal diameter" (ND) which is neither their outer diameter (OD) nor their inner diameter (ID) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_Pipe_Size)). 3/4" ND = 1.050" OD, and 1" ND = 1.315" OD.

The switch from 3/4" to 1" ND here makes no sense. It's almost certainly better
to use a 3/4" flange; I just didn't have one handy.

* Steel piping. All Schedule 40. I bought all mine from [Naylor Steel](https://www.naylorsteel.com/)
  * 3 x 3ft x 3/4" ND
  * 5 x 4ft x 3/4" ND
  * 1 x 2ft x 1" ND
* [Plastic caps](https://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/pipe-fittings/kee-klamp/133-plastic-plug)
  * 16 x 133-5
  * 2 x 133-6
* [Crossovers](https://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/pipe-fittings/kee-klamp/45-crossover)
  * 10 x 45-5
  * 1 x 45-65
  * Lowes sell a much cheaper version of the 45-5 made by SteelTek.

## Machine parts

* Raspberry Pi 4B https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/
  * Out of stock in several places as of 2023-08-27, but maybe possible to buy if you try all stores.
  * This is what I tested but it's possible much less computer would work - eg maybe you could make a Zero 2 W work. 
* Pibow case https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TWXN7ZB/
  * I haven't tested this yet but I'm hoping that this case can be screwed
    directly to the board.
  * No-one seems to make a case which is designed to be screwed to a board!
  * Someone could do a great thing by sharing laser-cuttable plans for a
    PiBow-like case which is designed for being screwed down.
* 6in USB A-C cable https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BKGTQ4L7/
  * I haven't tested this, my current power solution is much uglier.
* Plywood
  * My current build uses 1/4in; I'm going to try 3/8 in once I have a laser cutter.
  * The board is 4 in x 24 in
  * I buy 4 ft x 4 ft plywood from Home Depot
  * I think last time I  got them to cut it into two 2 ft x 4 ft pieces, then
    used a saw to make the 4in cuts.
  * This time I got them to cut it into a bunch of smaller pieces that'll fit in
    the laser cutter.

  * This lists various thread sizes, but threading didn't work out for me as a
    solution. I messaged the maker and asked for one secured with set screws; it
    has worked brilliantly. You'll need to do the same.
* Dildo - any Vac-U-Lock compatible one is good https://www.amazon.com/Doc-Johnson-Vac-U-Lock-ULTRASKYN-Compatible/dp/B00OMSZUTW

  * These are intended to screw the PiBow case to the board, but I haven't tested that yet.
